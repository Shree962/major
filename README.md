Files Created

I followed a structured Git workflow using feature branches to manage and improve my web page of edu tracking.

 ðŸ”¨ Step-by-Step Git Workflow

1. Started in the `master` branch:

   git checkout master ;
   vi bba.html, vi bcom.html ;
   git add . ;
   git commit -m "Add basic html tags and certain codes"

2. Branches

| Branch | Purpose                                       |
| ------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| `B1`   | Added Study timetable for bba |
| `B2`   | Added proper codes for Study timetable |
| `B3`   | Inserted Study timetable for bcom |
| `B4`   | Inserted Study time table with tracker for bcom |

3. Merging

git checkout master

Each file has two development branches that were merged into the master after testing and review.

Branches `B1`, `B2`, `B3`, and `B4` were created from `master`.

 Merging Summary:
- `B1` + `B2` â†’ merged into master in `bba.html`
- `B3` + `B4` â†’ merged into master in `bcom.html`
